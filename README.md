Emotion Recognition from Speech
📋 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to recognize human emotions from speech audio. The system analyzes audio features to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral states.
🎯 Objective
Automatically identify and classify emotions from speech audio using deep learning and signal processing techniques.
